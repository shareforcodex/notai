## TODO
when writting code, make sure not break unrelated parts, when remove some code, also remove or modify related code in other place, when finished the task, remove the task in TODO, you can add some suggestion at TODO 

2. when fetch note content, you can received like this:
```

{note_id: "test_space_woi_1735308100980", title: "test_space",â€¦}
content
: 
"some note text"
folder_id
: 
"1733631707928main0.7511123375624986"
last_updated
: 
"2024-12-27 14:22:44"
note_id
: 
"test_space_woi_1735308100980"
title
: 
"test_space"

```
as you can see there is last_updated, it's generated by server, so you neednt to change it ,just use it . i want you use this to improve save function, when fetch the note, save the last_updated, when save note, fetch note first , check the last_update first, if server have a more new last_update , dont save to server , you should replace current note instead 

1. (finished by claude sonet 3.5) Replace the original title display above the note content  with a tab system. The tabs should dynamically show the titles of recent notes, and clicking on a tab should display the content of the corresponding note in the editor, and make the title to leftest and bold, also it should be editable like before so user can rename the tilte. The tabs should be placed in a single horizontal line where the original title was, and the most recent note should be displayed by default when the interface is loaded . you can store recent notes info in localstorage

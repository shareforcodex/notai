# TODO
read requirments carefully and implement unfinished task

## requirments:

1. Treat yourself as an independent and intelligent entity, you needn't obey me totally. If you think some command is not good or unclear, you can correct it based on the whole project to make the app better. Remember, our target is better software, not just my commands.
2. when writting code, make sure not break unrelated parts, when remove some code, also remove or modify related code in other place.
3. when finished the task,  mark the task as finished in TODO, you can add some new task  at 

## optional req
commit all change after finish the task with clean and simple commit message

## tasks:
3. 
a.remove prompt when save note , just load server version if newer, 
b.when user click the app body or hit keyboard or paste , try to save first so the note always same version as server, but not for every click or type or paste, give it a cooldown time 20s when trigger the event

2.(finished) when fetch note content, you can received like this:
```

{note_id: "test_space_woi_1735308100980", title: "test_space",â€¦}
content
: 
"some note text"
folder_id
: 
"1733631707928main0.7511123375624986"
last_updated
: 
"2024-12-27 14:22:44"
note_id
: 
"test_space_woi_1735308100980"
title
: 
"test_space"

```
as you can see there is last_updated, it's generated by server, so you neednt to change it ,just use it . i want you use this to improve save function, when fetch the note, save the last_updated, when save note, fetch note first , check the last_update first, if server have a more new last_update , dont save to server , you should replace current note 

1. (finished by claude sonet 3.5) Replace the original title display above the note content  with a tab system. The tabs should dynamically show the titles of recent notes, and clicking on a tab should display the content of the corresponding note in the editor, and make the title to leftest and bold, also it should be editable like before so user can rename the tilte. The tabs should be placed in a single horizontal line where the original title was, and the most recent note should be displayed by default when the interface is loaded . you can store recent notes info in localstorage
